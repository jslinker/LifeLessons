# Rules for happy living
1. Never be ashamed of the music you like. Put Taylor Swift and Wu-Tang Clan in the same playlist and enjoy it confidently.
2. Being self-centered limits your ability to make a difference in the world.
3. Be humble. There's always someone who knows better than you.
4. Your identity is discovered, not manufactured, and you'll know you've found it when it points you towards something bigger than yourself.
